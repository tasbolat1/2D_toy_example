TODO:
1. find a way to sample data for the corrector
2. collect real world data
3. learn how to modify kernel functions of GP
    how does a GP get classification labels
    what is a kernel
    what are the different kinds of kernels

============================================

1. create two worlds
    A: sim world
    B: "real" world but still in simulator

2. refinement using data from two worlds
    TRAINING DATA:
        5 x 20 x N
        get old grasps and relabel?
        stricter parameters
        
============================================

1. check if there's a GP that you can initialize without training inputs
    - batched exact GP
    - approximate GP
    - dirichlet GP
2. complete pipeline of NN+GP

3. implement NN + GP using exact GP
    - extract feature vectors from data
        train_x (quat, trans, pc) -> 512-D vector
        train_y 0 or 1
    - initialize GP with 10k feature vectors
    - complete refinement
        
============================================

1. understand the mean
2. write corrector term part
